# Blockchain Voting System

This is a simple blockchain-based voting system where users can vote for candidates, and votes are stored in a blockchain. The system allows users to cast votes, mine new blocks, and view the blockchain with its associated votes. The backend is built with Flask, and the frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the Flask API.

## Features

- **Vote Submission**: Users can submit votes with a unique voter ID and a chosen candidate.
- **Blockchain**: All votes are recorded on the blockchain, which is mined by generating new blocks.
- **Real-time Updates**: The blockchain updates in real time every few seconds to reflect new votes and blocks.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask
- **Blockchain**: Python-based blockchain implementation
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Fetch API)
- **API**: RESTful API

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask (`pip install flask`)
- Basic knowledge of how to use a Flask server and how to interact with APIs using JavaScript (Fetch API).
